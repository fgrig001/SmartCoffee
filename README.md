# SmartCoffee
A Smart Coffee maker project to cleverly design electronics to make coffee so that we can continue creating projects like this one without having to exert precious energy. (By “exert energy” we mean push a button).

The primary goal of this project is to enable the user to start and stop their coffee maker from a remote location through the use of an intuitive mobile interface. The systems will also incorporate adequate safeguards as to ensure that coffee will be brewed in a timely manner without mishap or loss of life. However, we offer no guarantees.
